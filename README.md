# meningolockdownmodel
Meningococcal carriage model for the UK, incorporating the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, as used in Hadley et al., 2023.  
  
Model code is split into five key files:  
-a running script  
-model equations  
-useful shorthand functions  
-force of infection parameters  
-all other parameters  
  
There are also two input data files:
